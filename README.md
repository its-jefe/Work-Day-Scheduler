## Work Day Scheduler
### For those strict nine-to-fiver'ers 

This is [project #5][2] for [UCF Coding Bootcamp][1]

The front-end was designed off of a provided mock-up gif.

Handled all back-end development.

### Implements: 
- `jQuery` (`DOM` Manipulation)
- `moment.js` (although it is no longer being maintained)
- `soundcloud api` for Dolly Partons 9 to 5... remix (couldn't get the original)
- `localstorage`

### Usage
Plan out your 9 to 5 work day!

Write your tasks into a block and hit the '+' to update.
<em>If you want to remove a task you can must also hit the plus)</em>

❗️<i>just dont clear your localstorage</i>❗️

<u>Color key:</u>
- Green: You have time
- Red: The hour your currently in (better complete your task)
- Grey: Hour is over

### Future Developments
- Use the cloud instead of the fickle localstorage for the average user (although for a daily planner it's not the worst)
- I would like to allow the user to choose their own start and end times.
- Would be cool/fun to make a full calendar. 
- Add a trash button that allows you to delete notes more intuitively than hitting the plus again (with confirmation)
- Move away from the soundcloud api and use spotify with auth instead.
